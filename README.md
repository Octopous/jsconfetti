# jsconfetti
This is an explorative project for me to challenge myself in javascript codewriting. The project started when I was designing a poster I wanted to decorate with confetti, but I didn't feel like drawing hundreds of unique confetti flakes to place them randomly around the poster. So, what does one do? You create a generator that does it for you. Did I actually save time? Probably not. Did I enjoy creating the generator? Most certainly. That's a win in my books. And on top of that: I have a fun project to work on on and off. Feel free to look around and suggest improvements. Please do not use my code without my permission.
